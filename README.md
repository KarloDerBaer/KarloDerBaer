# Hi, I'm [Dein Name]! 🕹️

I'm a hobbyist developer and a full-time professional in a non-tech field. When I'm not spending time with my two kids, you’ll find me deep in code, exploring the world of **Game Development** and **Modding**.

### 🚀 What I'm working on
- 🎮 Game Dev: Creating small games and prototypes, mostly using the **Godot Engine**.
- 🛠️ Tool Development & Workflow Optimization: Since my coding time is limited, I'm obsessed with optimizing my creative process by building tools that make gamedev life easier.
- 📚 Constantly learning: I love jumping between languages and tools to see what’s possible.

### 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Game Dev:** Godot Engine (GDScript, C#)
- **Languages:** Python, C#, GDScript
- **Interests:** Modding, Game Mechanics, Logic & Scripting

### ☕ Support My Journey
Building games is my creative escape. Balancing a career, family, and gamedev is a challenge, but I love every minute of it. If you enjoy my mods or small games, you can support my late-night sessions here:
